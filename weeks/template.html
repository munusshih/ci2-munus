                    Use pen and paper, create a sitemap: a
                    visualization of
                    the structure of your website. Think about
                    how you want to
                    retell the text youâ€™ve chosen and how you
                    can take advantage
                    of the non-linear potential of the web to
                    create a new
                    experience for the reader. How many pages
                    will you need? In
                    what order should the user navigate those
                    pages?
