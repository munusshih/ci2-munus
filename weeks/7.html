        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>We're moving this class online to stand in solidarity with the
            student workers. Today we have a guest lecturer Hasan Khalid to
            speak about his experience as a developer working with clients, and
            then we'll do a small crit session of everyone's class website. And
            finally kick off on our journey into the world of Javascript. The
            session is being recorded and I'll post the link to slack later.</p>

        <h4>Assignments</h4>
        <p class="space--after-single">The assignment is broken into two parts.
            Please finish the following
            things after choosing an existing piece of text you'd like to work
            with.</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="space--after-double">
                <h5>Project 2-1: Concept & Data Collection </h5>
                <p class="space--after-single">Create a collection of 25 to 50
                    items. 
                    Think about the theme of your data? What kind of data?
                    Collect these data and label them with a unique
                    identifier. Think about all the lables you can give them,
                    such as colors, sizes, weights, years made, smell, emotion
                    and etc. Prepare to discuss them in a 1-on-1 with Munus.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="space--after-double">
                <h5>Project 2-2: Low-fidelity Prototype</h5>
                <p class="space--after-single">Consider how the collection is
                    organized and experienced — one at a time, in a grid, on
                    separate pages? Consider if there are groupings within your
                    collection and how the relationship between typography and
                    mixed media can add a visual perspective to your work. Use
                    pen and paper or digital prototyping software (such as
                    Figma) to demosntrate your concept. Prepare to discuss them
                    in a 1-on-1 with Munus.</p>
