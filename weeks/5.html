        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This week, we will shift our focus to a pivotal aspect of web design:
            responsive design! We will delve into its rich history, technical
            evolution, diverse philosophical approaches, and its growing
            significance in contemporary contexts. Then, we will explore the
            intricacies of designing layouts with a keen understanding of
            flexbox, media queries, and fluid typography, in order to adapt to
            various devices and screen sizes.</p>
