        <p class="space--after-single">The assignment is broken into two parts.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5><span>Project 3-5: Presentation</span></h5>
                <p class="space--after-single">
                    Continue to refine your clock so its functionality is nailed down. Polish any remaining design elements: layout, typography, visual language, etc. See if you can make your clock responsive across different devices (revisit fluid units and media queries)!
                </p>
                <p class="space--after-single">
                    Develop a presentation for Project 3 that walks us through your process and idea. You will have 3 minutes to present, so think about how you can give us a succinct yet thorough walkthrough of your work. Make sure you cover the following points in your presentation:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="space--after-single">
                        Purpose and Approach: Introduce your concept and the main purpose of your clock. Discuss your approach to developing it.
                    </li>
                    <li class="space--after-single">
                        Clock: Show us your live clock. Walk us through the data you’re using, and how it’s driving the form and/or content of your clock. Did you use the map function to help “normalize” your data? Talk about the design decisions you made, and how they contribute to the concept and functionality of your clock.
                    </li>
                    <li class="space--after-single">
                        Website: Show us your live site. Highlight key features
                        such as menus, links, and buttons that facilitate
                        seamless navigation for users. Discuss any design
                        decisions you made in styling.
<br><br>
                        For those whose project focuses on the concept of time and will evolve based on the current time of day, please prepare recordings or screenshots of your work captured at different times throughout the day so it will be easier to discuss.
                    </li>
                    <li class="space--after-single">
                        Responsiveness: Show us your website across different
                        dimensions using the inspect tool.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h5><span>Final Preso Party</span></h5>
                <p class="space--after-single">
                    Prepare a 3-minute presentation that walks us through your final project + one additional project from this class if you'd like. It could be anything from your class website, project 1/2 after refinement to just pracitces. You will have 3 minutes to present, so think about how you can give us a succinct yet thorough walkthrough of your work.
                </p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Make sure to link out all your files correctly from your Class Website.  I’m inviting my mentor / studio mate Richard Lehmann, who is an amazing creative coder who have work with prestigious clients like Square, Adidas, Dolby, Microsoft, IBM, and CNN. Richard will help criting your work, please prepare to talk about your Experimental Clock + another additional work if you like for crit.</p>
                <p>As always, please reach out if you have more questions.</p>
