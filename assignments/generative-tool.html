        In this project, we’ll explore the boundaries of what a
        generative
        tool can be when it is made on the web. Students will
        develop a
        website that generates content and form by an audience’s
        input
        based on a set of rules. This can take the form of a
        practical
        tool or an abstract online experience. Students are
        encouraged to
        test and try the tool they made, along with their
        friends and
        peers.

            <h3>Part 1: Concept & Sketches</h3>
            <p>
                Come up with three distinct ideas for a website
                that utilizes
                an input and an output. Determine what the input
                and output
                would be. For instance, when the user speaks
                into a
                microphone, will text appear? Consider who or
                what this tool
                is for. Do you want to make something that is
                useful,
                semi-useful or not useful at all? Bring
                references and
                sketches for each direction. References can be
                websites,
                artworks, music, photographs, or anything else
                that sparks an
                idea.

            <h3>Part 2: Digital Prototype</h3>
            <p>
                Choose one of the three directions and begin
                prototyping it in
                Figma (or any prototyping software that you are
                familiar
                with). Feel free to also bring in code tests or
                references if
                that helps to explore your idea.

            <h3>Part 3: Coded Draft</h3>
            <p>
                Create a coded draft of your website. If you are
                running into
                technical or code issues, this is the time to
                simplify the
                idea to make it more attainable for yourself.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 4: Refinement & Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Refine your work based on feedback. Get the tech
                in your coded
                draft to work. Start thinking about style and
                how it relates
                to your audience. Test the tool with at least
                three different
                people. Consider how to further develop your
                project based on
                the testers’ feedback.

            <h3>Part 5: Polish & Present</h3>
            <p>
                Complete the project, ensuring that your website
                is polished
                and fully functional. This is the culmination of
                your efforts,
                so make sure to pay attention to every detail.
                Develop a
                presentation that walks us through your process
                and project.
