        Students will explore unconventional ways to visualize
        time by
        developing a time-based website. Students should
        consider
        different ways to visualize time: with or without
        numbers,
        literally or abstractly. The clock can be for a
        particular use
        case or have no specific function. A successful project
        is
        formally and conceptually resolved, and functional and
        interactive
        as a clock in some interesting way. Students are
        challenged to
        envision their work not just as static representations,
        but as
        dynamic forms.

            <h3>Part 1: Concept & Sketches</h3>
            <p>
                Sketch out 10-15 distinct concepts using pen and
                paper. One
                sketch should be purely typographic and one
                should be purely
                illustrative. Select two concepts to move
                forward with. If
                your clock has a specific use case, consider any
                relevant time
                intervals. If you feel like getting ahead: bring
                the two
                sketches you'd like to move forward with into a
                digital tool
                of your choice (e.g. Illustrator, Figma). The
                goal is to use
                the digital medium to help you visualize the
                opportunities
                within each concept.

            <h3>Part 2: Digital Prototype</h3>
            <p>
                Bring the two concepts youâ€™ve chosen into a
                digital tool of
                your choice (e.g., Illustrator, Figma), with the
                goal in mind
                to use the digital medium to help you visualize
                opportunities
                within each concept. Feel free to also bring in
                code tests or
                references if that helps to explore your idea.

            <h3>Part 3: Coded Draft</h3>
            <p>
                Create a coded draft of your website. If you are
                running into
                technical or code issues, this is the time to
                simplify the
                idea to make it more attainable for yourself.
                Work in the
                real-time data.

            <h3>Part 5: Polish & Present</h3>
            <p>
                Continue to polish your work. Develop a
                presentation that
                walks us through your process and project.
