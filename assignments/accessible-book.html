        Students will choose a piece of text to work with and
        typeset it
        as a web page. Students should consider how they can
        redesign
        their texts as a website to take advantage of the
        dynamic and
        non-linear potential of the web to create a new
        experience for the
        reader. The website should consist of at least five
        pages. A
        successful project requires careful consideration of
        navigation
        and typography to create a compelling new experience for
        the
        reader.

            <h3>Part 1: Concept & Sitemaps</h3>
            <p>
                Using pen and paper, create a sitemap: a
                visualization of the
                structure of your website. Think about how you
                want to retell
                the text youâ€™ve chosen and how you can take
                advantage of the
                non-linear potential of the web to create a new
                experience for
                the reader. How many pages will you need? In
                what order should
                the user navigate those pages?

            <h3>Part 2: Start with HTML</h3>
            <p>
                Transition from paper to code by setting up your
                code
                environment and HTML files. Develop a semantic
                structure that
                enhances accessibility. Pay particular attention
                to keyboard
                navigation (Tab, Enter) to make your web content
                inclusive and
                user-friendly.

            <h3>Part 3: Style with CSS</h3>
            <p>
                Now that your structure is in place, it's time
                to style it
                using CSS. Consider using design tools like
                Figma to plan your
                layout.

            <h3>Part 4: Make it Responsive</h3>
            <p>
                Make your project responsive. Incorporate fluid
                units and
                media queries to ensure a seamless experience
                across different
                devices.

            <h3>Part 5: Polish & Present</h3>
            <p>
                Continue to refine your work. Does your project
                align with
                accessibility standards? Does it consider
                diverse audiences?
                Develop a presentation that walks us through
                your process and
                project.
